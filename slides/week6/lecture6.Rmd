# Midterm evaluation survey

## Midterm evaluation survey

Please fill out the following survey so that I can improve the course if necessary: https://goo.gl/forms/cyo5svHi4DmLkDWN2

# Prerequisites

## Packages

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

## Data

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# base GitHub url
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/",
              "mhaber/HertieDataScience/master/",
              "slides/week6/data/")

# link to datasets
pew <- read_csv(paste0(url,"pew.csv"))
billboard <- read_csv(paste0(url,"billboard.csv"))
weather <- read_tsv(paste0(url,"weather.txt"))
```


## Tidy data

Data come in multiple ways. Take the the following datasets: they show the same values of four variables *country*, *year*, *population*, and *cases*, but each dataset organises the values in a different way:

## Tidy data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table1)
```

## Tidy data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table2)
```

## Tidy data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table3)
```

## Tidy data

- In tidy data:

    + Each variable forms a column
    + Each observation forms a row
    + Each type of observational unit forms a table

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy.png")
```  

- Any dataset that doesn't satisfy these conditions is considered 'messy'

## Tidy data

Why data should be tidy:

1.  \alert{Consistency}: If you have a consistent data structure, it's easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.
    
2. \alert{Conformity}: R is a vectorized programming language. Data structures in R are built from vectors and R’s operations are optimized to work with vectors. Tidy data takes advantage of both of these traits.

3. \alert{Compatibility}: dplyr, ggplot2, and all the other packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data.


## Tidy data

Assume that in these data sets, cases refers to the number of people diagnosed with TB per country per year. To calculate the rate of TB cases per country per year (i.e, the number of people per 10,000 diagnosed with TB), you will need to do four operations with the data. You will need to:

* Extract the number of TB cases per country per year

* Extract the population per country per year (in the same order as above)

* Divide cases by population

* Multiply by 10000

## Tidy data

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
# Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

## Tidy data
```{r, out.width = "50%"}
# Compute cases per year
table1 %>% 
  dplyr::count(year, wt = cases)
```

## Exercises

Raw data is rarely tidy and is much harder to work with as a result

1.  Compute the `rate` for `table2`. You will need to perform four operations:

    1.  Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
    1.  Extract the matching population per country per year.
    1.  Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
    1.  Store back in the appropriate place.
    
## Exercises solutions
```{r}
cases <- table2 %>% 
  dplyr::filter(type == "cases") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(count)
country <- table2 %>% 
  dplyr::filter(type == "cases") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(country)
year <- table2 %>% 
  dplyr::filter(type == "cases") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(year)
population <- table2 %>% 
  dplyr::filter(type == "population") %>% 
  dplyr::pull(count)
```

## Exercises solutions
```{r}
table2Tidy <- tibble(country = country,
       year = year,
       rate = cases / population * 10000)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table2Tidy)
```

# gathering and spreading

## `gather()` and `spread()` 

The two most important functions in `tidyr` are `gather()` and `spread()`. `tidyr` builds on the idea of a key value pair. A key that explains what the information describes, and a value that contains the actual information (e.g. _Password: 0123456789_). 

`gather()` makes wide tables narrower and longer; `spread()` makes long tables shorter and wider.

## pew data

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(pew[1:3,1:5])
```

* What variables are in this dataset?

* How does a tidy version of this table look like?

## `gather()`

* Problem: Column names are not names of a variable, but _values_

* Goal: Gather the non-variable volumns into a two-column key-value pair

## `gather()`

Three parameters:

1. Set of columns that represent values, not variables

2. The name of the variable whose values form the column names (\alert{key}).

3. The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells (\alert{value}).

## `gather()`

```{r}
pewTidy <- pew %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key = income, value = frequency,
                -religion)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(pewTidy[1:5,1:3])
```

## Billboard data

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(billboard[1:5,1:4])
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(billboard[1:5,5:10])
```

* What are the variables here?

## Tidying the Billboard data 

To tidy this dataset, we first `gather` together all the `wk` columns. The column names give the week and the values are the ranks:

```{r}
billboardTidy <- billboard %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key = week, value = rank,
                wk1:wk76, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Tidying the Billboard data 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(billboardTidy[1:4,1:4])
knitr::kable(billboardTidy[1:4,5:7])
```

Are we done?

## data cleaning with `dplyr()`

Let's turn the week into a numeric variable and create a proper date column

```{r}
billboardTidy2 <- billboardTidy %>%
  dplyr::mutate(week = readr::parse_number(week),
                date = as.Date(date.entered) + 7 * 
                  (week - 1)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-date.entered) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(artist, track, week)
```

## data cleaning with `dplyr()`

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(billboardTidy2[1:4,1:4])
knitr::kable(billboardTidy2[1:4,5:7])
```

##`spread()`

Spreading is the opposite of gathering. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. `spread()` turns a pair of key:value columns into a set of tidy columns. 

For example, take `table2`: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table2[1:7,])
```

## `spread()`
To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `gather()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

* The column that contains variable names, the `key` column. Here, it's 
  `type`.

* The column that contains values forms multiple variables, the `value`
  column. Here it's `count`.

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/spread.png")
```  

## `spread()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table2 %>% 
  tidyr::spread(key = type, value = count)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
table2Tidy <- table2 %>% 
  tidyr::spread(key = type, value = count)
knitr::kable(table2Tidy)
```

## Exercises

1. Are `gather()` and `spread()` perfectly symmetrical? Carefully consider the following example:
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
    )
stocks %>% 
  tidyr::spread(year, return) %>% 
  tidyr::gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```

2. Both `spread()` and `gather()` have a `convert` argument. What does it do?

## Exercises

3.  Why does this code fail?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table4a %>% 
  tidyr::gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

4.Using the `weather` data: Tidy the day columns `X1-X31` and save the result as `weatherTidy`. Finally, spread the measure column of weatherTidy and save the result as `weatherTidy2`.
 
## Exercises solutions

1. `gather()` and `spread()` are not perfectly symmetrical because column type information is not transferred between them (i.e. `year` column).

2. The convert argument tries to convert character vectors to the appropriate type.

3. The column names `1999` and `2000` are not standard and thus need to be quoted. 
4. 

```{r}
weatherTidy <- weather %>% 
  tidyr::gather(day, value, X1:X9, na.rm = TRUE)
weatherTidy2 <- weatherTidy %>% 
  tidyr::spread(measure, value)
```

# Separating and uniting

##  `separate()`

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. Take `table3`:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table3)
```

##  `separate()`

The `rate` column contains both `cases` and `population` variables, and we need to split it into two variables. `separate()` takes the name of the column to separate, and the names of the columns to separate into.

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/separate.png")
```  

##  `separate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  tidyr::separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
table3Tidy <- table3 %>% 
  tidyr::separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
knitr::kable(table3Tidy)
```

## `separate()`

By default, `separate()` will split values at non-alphanumeric characters (!number, !letter). If you wish to use a specific character to separate a column, you can pass the character to the `sep` argument of `separate()`.

## `separate()`

```{r eval = FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  tidyr::separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"),
                  sep = "/")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
table3Tidy <- table3 %>% 
  tidyr::separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"),
                  sep = "/")
knitr::kable(table3Tidy)
```

## `separate()`

You can also pass a vector of integers to `sep`. `separate()` will interpret the integers as positions to split at. Positive values start at 1 on the far-left of the strings; negative value start at -1 on the far-right of the strings.

You can use this arrangement to separate the last two digits of each year. This make this data less tidy, but is useful in other cases, as you'll see in a little bit.

## `separate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  tidyr::separate(year, into = c("century", "year"),
                  sep = 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
table3Tidy <- table3 %>% 
  tidyr::separate(year, into = c("century", "year"),
                  sep = 2)
knitr::kable(table3Tidy)
```

## `unite()`

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column. You'll need it much less frequently than `separate()`, but it's still a useful tool to have in your back pocket.

We can use `unite()` to rejoin the *century* and *year* columns in `table5`. `unite()` takes a data frame, the name of the new variable to create, and a set of columns to combine.

## `unite()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table5 %>% 
  tidyr::unite(new, century, year)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
table5Tidy <- table5 %>% 
  tidyr::unite(new, century, year)
knitr::kable(table5Tidy)
```

## `unite()`

By default, `unite()` will place an underscore (`_`) between the values from different columns. If we don't want any separator we use `""`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table5 %>% 
  tidyr::unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
table5Tidy <- table5 %>% 
  tidyr::unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
knitr::kable(table5Tidy)
```

# Missing values

## Missing values

> "An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit missing value is the absence of a presence."

A value can be missing in one of two possible ways:

* _Explicitly_ i.e. flagged with `NA`.
* _Implicitly_, i.e. simply not present in the data.

Let's illustrate this idea with a very simple data set:

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
```

## Missing values

There are two missing values in this dataset:

* The return for the 4th quarter of 2015 is explicitly missing (`NA`).
  
* The return for the 1st quarter of 2016 is implicitly missing.
  
We can make the implicit missing value explicit by putting years in the columns:

## Missing values

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stocks %>% 
  tidyr::spread(year, return)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
stocksTidy <- stocks %>% 
  tidyr::spread(year, return)
knitr::kable(stocksTidy)
```

## Remove missing values

You can also set `na.rm = TRUE` in `gather()` to turn explicit missing values implicit:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stocks %>% 
  tidyr::spread(year, return) %>% 
  tidyr::gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
stocksTidy <- stocks %>% 
  tidyr::spread(year, return) %>% 
  tidyr::gather(year, return, `2015`:`2016`, na.rm = TRUE)
knitr::kable(stocksTidy)
```

## `complete()`
You can also use `complete()` for making missing values explicit. `complete()` takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations; filling in explicit `NA`s where necessary.

## `complete()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stocks %>% 
  tidyr::complete(year, qtr)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
stocksTidy <- stocks %>% 
  tidyr::complete(year, qtr)
knitr::kable(stocksTidy)
```

## `fill()`

Finally, you can fill in missing values with `fill()`. It takes a set of columns where you want missing values to be replaced by the most recent non-missing value (sometimes called last observation carried forward).

```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)
```

## `fill()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
treatment %>% 
  tidyr::fill(person)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
treatmentTidy <- treatment %>% 
  tidyr::fill(person)
knitr::kable(treatmentTidy)
```

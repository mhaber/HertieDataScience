# Markup language and literate programming

## Objective for today

What is literate programming? Why is it important for reproducible research?

- Introduction to \alert{Markdown}

- Introduction to \alert{R Markdown}:

    + Simple pages
    + PDF papers
    + Presentations
    + References

- Slides adapted from Christopher Gandrud's course on [Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/christophergandrud)

## What is literate programming?

Literate programming: a program using \alert{natural language} interspersed
with \alert{code snippets} that are compilable by a computer.
[Donald Knuth (1992)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming):

This produces two representations of the program:

- A formatted easily human readable document (e.g. a paper).
- Source code that can be compiled by a computer.

## General benefits

\alert{Creates better programs} by forcing programmers to explicitly state thoughts

\alert{Clear documentation} so that others can understand and build on the program

## Benefits related to research

> Quantitative social science is computer programming.

* You are creating a program that gathers and analyses data.

* You then advertise this work (a paper) in a way that is completely
understandable to others.


## Implementing literate programming

In addition to the computer language, we need:

1. Natural language part formatted using a markup language.
Markup language: typesetting instructions. E.g. Markdown, LaTeX, HTML.

2. A way to tangle or weave the computer language part into the natural
language part.

## `knitr` for R

In R you can use the `knitr` package.

Two parts:

- Natural language part written in intended markup language.

- R code (or almost any other language on your system) written in code chunks.

## Latex Output

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/simpleKnitrExampleOut.png")
```

In a knitr-LaTeX document (also known as R Sweave and has the file extension `.Rnw`) code chunks are delimited with `<< >>=` and `@`.

## PDF Output

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/simpleKnitrExample.png")
```

## The `knitr` process

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/knitr_process.png")
```

# R Markdown

## R Markdown

Most of the focus is on [RStudio's R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Directly builds on knitr (developer works at RStudio now).

    + Code chunk syntax is almost identical to Markdown in knitr.

- But uses [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to be more output agnostic.

    + You can write in R Markdown and output to many different formats.
    
## Markdown

Originally created by John Gruber to be an easy way to:

- write HTML files

- that are human readable as text files

## Markdown: HTML less painful

\footnotesize

**HTML**:

```
<h1>A header</h1>

<p>Some text with a <a href="http://www.example.com">link</a></p>

<p>Here is some <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
```

**Markdown**:

```
# A header

This is some text with a [link](http://www.example.com).

Here is some **bold** text.
```
\normalsize


## Markdown syntax: Headers

```
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3
```

And so on.

## Markdown syntax

Horizontal lines:

```
---
```

Bold text:

```
**bold**
```

Italics:

```
*italics*
```

## Markdown syntax

Links:

```
[link](http://www.example.com)
```

Images:

```
![text description](FILE/PATH.png)
```

## Markdown syntax

Unordered Lists:

```
- An item

- An item

- An item
```

Ordered Lists:

```
1. Item one

2. Item two

3. Item three
```

## Tables

```
| Name   | Something |
| ------ | --------- |
| Stuff  | Things    |
| Things | Stuff     |
```
| Name   | Something |
| ------ | --------- |
| Stuff  | Things    |
| Things | Stuff     |

## Math

\footnotesize

R Markdown from RStudio supports [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). So, you can
write any [LaTeX math](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) with
R Markdown.

```
Inline equations have one dollar sign $s^2 =
\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.
```

**Inline equations** have one dollar sign $s^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$.

**Display equations** have two dollar signs:

```
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$
```

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$
\normalsize

## Code chunks Inline

To use syntax highlighting on code chunks inline with the text, surround your text
with ` `

For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.
```

Produces:

Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.

## Code chunks in Display

```{r, echo = FALSE, comment=NA}
cat("Use three ticks ``` to start and end a code chunk that
    is not run.")
cat("Create a knit-able code chunk begin the chunk with ```{r}")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/simpleRMarkdown.png")
```

## Automatic table generation

You can turn any matrix or data frame into a well formatted table with the knitr
function `kable`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```

Make sure that the code chunk option `results='asis'`.

## Output Web

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/simpleRMarkdownOut.png")
```

## Output PDF or Word

A R Markdown file can be compiled to PDF (via LaTeX) or MS Word with RStudio.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="150px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chooseOutput.png")
```

## Output PDF

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/simpleMarkdownPDF.png")
```

## Output Word

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/simpleMarkdownWord.png")
```

## Chunk options
```{r, echo = FALSE, comment=NA}
cat("Change how R Markdown chunks behave with options. Place
options in the chunk head: ```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE}")
```



\footnotesize

| Option          | What it Does                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `echo=FALSE`    | Does not print the code only the output                    |
| `error=FALSE`   | Does not print errors                                      |
| `include=FALSE` | Does not include the code or output, but does run the code |
| `fig.width`     | Sets figure width                                          |
| `cache=TRUE`    | Cache the chunk. It is only run when the contents change.  |

# RMarkdown Presentations

## RMarkdown Presentations

These lecture slides are created using R Markdown.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/createPresentation.png")
```

## RMarkdown Presentations

All of the syntax is the same, except:

`##` Does not mean Header 2. It is creates a new slide and title.

You can create a slide with no title using `---`.

## R Markdown Header

An R Markdown file is just a text file with markup instructions that RStudio
understands. The key to document-consistent formatting is the header.

It is at the start of a file and comes between `---`.

The header is written in [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

The header lets you make changes to the whole document.

## YAML

YAML is a human read-able data format ("YAML Ain't Markup Language").

Elements are separated from values with a colon (`:`).

Each element is separated by new lines.

Hierarchy is maintained with tabs.

## YAML

This presentation's head is:

\footnotesize

```

title: "Data Management With R: Markup languages"
author: "Matthias Haber"
date: "13 November 2017"
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    theme: "metropolis"
    colortheme: "default"
    fonttheme: "default"
    fig_caption: false
    df_print: default
    toc: false
  ioslides_presentation:
  slidy_presentation: default
---
```
\normalsize

## Different Presentation Styles

By defualt, R Markdown uses the [ioslides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html)
HTML presentation slides style.

You can also use `beamer_presentation` style that you may know from LaTeX by changing the output in the 
YAML header:

```
output: revealjs::revealjs_presentation
```

## Table of Contents & Numbered Sections

You can add a table of contents and numbered sections to your PDF output:

```
output:
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
```

To do the same for `HTML` also include the information under `html_document`.

## Figure Options

Create consistent figure formatting:

```
output:
  pdf_document:
    fig_width: 7
    fig_height: 6
    fig_caption: true
```

`fig_caption: true` attaches captions to figures.

To set the actual caption label, use `fig.cap='SOME CAPTION'`.

## Pandoc footnotes

R Markdown can use Pandoc footnotes.

In-text: In the text place a unique footnote key in the format:

* `[^KEY]`

End: At the end your document put the full footnote starting with the key,
e.g.

* `[^KEY]: This is a footnote.`

# Citations in R Markdown

## BibTeX citations

BibTex allows you to create a database of all of the literature/packages
you cite.

You can then insert them into your text and they will:

* Be automatically formatted consistently.

* Generate an appropriately ordered, consistently formatted reference list at
the end of your document with only the works you actually cited.

## The BibTeX Database

A BibTeX database is just a text file with the extension `.bib`.

Each entry follows a standard format depending on the type of media.

```
@DOCUMENT_TYPE{CITE_KEY,
    title = {TITLE},
    author = {AUTHOR},
    . . . = {. . .},
}
```

Note: Commas are very important!

## The Cite Key

The cite key links a specific citation in your presentation document to a specific
BibTeX database entry. They must be unique.

It does not matter what order your BibTeX entries are in the `.bib` file.

## BibTeX Articles
\footnotesize

```
@article{Acemoglu2000,
    author = {Acemoglu, Daron and Robinson, James A.},
    title = {Why Did the West Extend the Franchise? Democracy,
            Inequality,and Growth in Historical Perspective},
    journal = {The Quarterly Journal of Economics},
    year = {2000},
    volume = {115},
    number = {4},
    pages = {1167--1199},
}
```
\normalsize

## BibTeX Books

\footnotesize

```
@book{Cox1997,
    title={Making Votes Count: Strategic Coordination in the World's
            Electoral Systems},
    author={Gary W. Cox},
    year={1997},
    volume = {7},
    publisher={Cambridge University Press},
    address = {Cambridge}
}
```
\normalsize

## More

For more media types and entry fields see
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX).

## Tip: Google Scholar

Google scholar generates BibTeX entries.

On an entry click `Cite > BibTeX`.

For a YouTube how-to see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsJSR2b4_qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsJSR2b4_qc).

Sometimes they need to be cleaned a little.

## Linking your .bib file.

To link your `.bib` file to your RMarkdown document add to the header:

```
bibliography:
    - BIB_FILE_NAME.bib
    - ANOTHER_BIB_FILE_NAME.bib
```

Note: The files should be in the same directory as your R Markdown file.

## Including BibTeX citations in RMarkdown

R Markdown uses [Pandoc syntax](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)
to include a citation in-text.

General format: `@CITE_KEY`.

So if the cite key is `Box1973` then `@Box1973` will return @Box1973 in the text
of the presentation document.

## Formatting In-Text Citations
\footnotesize

| Markup                      | Result                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `[@Box1973]`                | [@Box1973]                |
| `[see @Box1973]`            | [see @Box1973]            |
| `[see @Box1973, 33-40]`     | [see @Box1973, 33-40]     |
| `[@Box1973; @Acemoglu2000]` | [@Box1973; @Acemoglu2000] |
| `@Box1973 [33-40]`          | @Box1973 [33-40]          |

\normalsize

## Reference List

A reference list with the full bibliographic details of all cited documents
will be automatically created at the end of your document.

Tip: Put `# References` at the very end of your R Markdown document to
have a section heading before the reference list.

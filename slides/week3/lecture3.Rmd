# Making sure everyone is set up

## Packages

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(nycflights13)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(flights[1:4, 1:6])
```

# Data transformation with dplyr

## Piping

The pipe operator `%>%` (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+M) allows you to write code in sequences which has several benefits:

- serves the natural way of reading ("First this, then this, ...")
- avoids nested function calls
- minimizes the need for local variables and function definitions

## Piping

`dplyr` is designed to work with the pipe, so this

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>% 
  filter(year == 2017)  %>% 
  select(x, y)
```

returns the sames as this

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(filter(df, year == 2017) x, y)
```

## Variable types

- \alert{int}: integers

- \alert{dbl}: doubles, or real numbers

- \alert{chr}: character vectors, or strings

- \alert{dttm}: date-times (a date + a time)

- \alert{lgl}: logical, vectors that contain only `TRUE` or `FALSE`

- \alert{fctr}: factors

- \alert{date}: dates

## `dplyr` core functions

- `filter()`: select rows by their values
- `arrange()`: order rows
- `select()`: select columns by their names
- `mutate()`: create new variables
- `summarize()`: collapse many values down to a single summary

- `group_by()`: operate on it group-by-group
- `rename()`: rename columns
- `distinct()`: find distinct rows

Command structure (for all dplyr verbs):

- first argument is a data frame
- return value is a data frame
- nothing is modified in place


## `filter()`

`filter()` allows to subset observations based on their values. The function takes logical expressions and returns the rows for which all are `TRUE`. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/filter.png")
```  

## `filter()`

Let's select all flights on January 1st:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)[1:6, 1:6])
```

## `filter()`

`filter()` revolves around using comparison operators: 
`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal).

`dplyr` functions like `filter()` never modify inputs but instead return a new data frame that needs to be assigned to an object if you want to save the result.   
```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

## Boolean operators

`filter()` also supports the Boolean operators `&` ("and"), `|` ("or"), `!` (is "not"), and `xor` (exclusive "or".

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/operators.png")
``` 

De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` = `!x | !y` & `!(x | y)` = `!x & !y`

## Boolean operators

Why does this not work?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)
```

Generally a good idea to use `x %in% y`, which will select every row where `x` is part of the values of `y`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

## `between` condition

Another useful dplyr filtering helper is `between()`. `between(x, left, right)` is equivalent to `x >= left & x <= right`.

```{r}

```

To `filter()` all flights that departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive): 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, between(dep_time, 0, 600))
```

## `filter()` exclusion

`filter()` by default excludes `FALSE` and `NA` values. 
```{r, df_print = "default"}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
```

## `filter()` exclusion

If you want to preserve missing values, you have to explicitly state it.
```{r}
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## `filter()` exercises

1.  Find all flights that

    a. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours.
    b. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late.
    c. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`).
    d. Were operated by United, American, or Delta.
    e. Departed in summer (July, August, and September).

## `filter()` exercises solutions
Arrival delay of two or more hours
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 120)
```

Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
filter(!is.na(dep_delay), dep_delay <= 0, arr_delay > 120)
```

Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
```

## `filter()` exercises solutions
Were operated by United, American, or Delta
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
filter(carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))
```

Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
filter(between(month, 7, 9))
```

## `arrange()`

`arrange()` takes a data frame and a set of column names to order the rows by. Multiple column names are evaluated subsequently.    

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(arrange(flights, year, month, day)[1:6, 1:6])
```

## `arrange()` in descending order
By dafault `arrange()` sorts values in ascending order. Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))[1:6, 1:6])
```

## `arrange()` exercises
2. Sort `flights` to 

    a. find the flight that departed the earliest (earlier than scheduled)
    b. find the most delayed flight.
    c. find the flight that travelled the longest and that travelled the shortest distance.

## `arrange()` exercises solutions

Flight B6 97 left the earliest (43 minutes early).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
arrange(dep_delay)
```

Flight HA 51 is the most delayed flight (1301 minutes delay).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```

Flight HA 51 is the longest (4,983 miles), flight US 1632 is the shortest (17 miles).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
arrange(desc(distance))
```

## `select()`

`select()` is used to select a subset of variables from a dataset. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/select.png")
```  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(select(flights, year, month, day)[1:4,])
```

## `select()`

`select()` has various helper functions:

* `everything()`: selects all variables.

* `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with "abc".

* `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with "xyz".

* `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain "ijk".

* `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression.

*  `num_range("x", 1:3)` matches `x1`, `x2` and `x3`.
   
See `?select` for more details.

## `select()`

You can use `select()` to rename variables

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

which will drop all of the variables not explicitly mentioned. Therefore it's better to use `rename()` instead:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

## `select()` exercises

3.1 What are three distinct ways to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`,
    `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from `flights`.

3.2 What does the `one_of()` function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

```{r}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay",
          "arr_delay")
```
    
## `select()` exercise solutions

Three distinct ways to select variables.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, starts_with("dep_"), starts_with("arr_"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(flights, matches("^(dep|arr)_(time|delay)$"))
```

What does the `one_of()` function do?
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay",
          "arr_delay")
select(flights, one_of(vars))
```

## `mutate()`

`mutate()` allows to add new columns to the end of your dataset that are functions of existing columns.

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mutate.png")
```  

## `mutate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time) %>% 
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
         speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
test <- flights %>% 
  select(ends_with("delay"), distance, air_time) %>% 
  mutate(gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
         speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
knitr::kable(test[1:6,])
```

## `transmute()`

Use `transmute()` to only keep the new variables:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
transmute(flights,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

## Functions to use with `mutate()`
There are many functions for creating new variables with `mutate()`:

* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (e.g. `air_time / 60`).
* Aggregate functions: `sum(x)` `mean(y)` (e.g. `mean(dep_delay)`).
* Modular arithmetic: `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (remainder), where
    `x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y)`.
* Logs: `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`.
* Offsets: `lead()` and `lag()` (e.g. `x - lag(x)`).
* Cumulative and rolling aggregates: `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`, `cummean()`.    
* Logical comparisons, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`.
* Ranking: `min_rank()`, `row_number()`, `dense_rank()`, `percent_rank()`, `cume_dist()`, `ntile()`.

## `mutate()` exercises

4. Use `mutate()` to

    a. Create new variables for `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` that measure time in the number of minutes after midnight.
    b. Compare `air_time` with `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?
    c. Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties?

## `mutate()` exercise solutions

New variables for `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_time2 = dep_time %/% 100 * 60 + 
           dep_time %% 100,
         sched_dep_time2 = sched_dep_time %/% 100 *
           60 + sched_dep_time %% 100) %>%
  select(dep_time, dep_time2, sched_dep_time,
         sched_dep_time2)
```

## `mutate()` exercise solutions

`arr_time` and `dep_time` may be in different time zones.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  mutate(air_time2 = arr_time - dep_time,
       air_time_diff = air_time2 - air_time) %>%
  filter(air_time_diff != 0) %>%
  select(air_time, air_time2, dep_time, arr_time, dest)
```

10 most delayed flights
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  mutate(dep_delay_rank = min_rank(-dep_delay)) %>%
  arrange(dep_delay_rank) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay_rank <= 10)
```

## `summarize()`

`summarize()` collapses a data frame to a single row.

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/summarise.png")
```  

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `summarize()` with `group_by()`
`summarize()` is most effectively used with `group_by()`, which changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. 

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/group.png")
```  

Grouping is most useful in conjunction with `summarise()`, but you can also do convenient operations with `mutate()` and `filter()`.

## `summarize()` with `group_by()`
For example, to get the average delay per date

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```



## `summarize()` count
For aggregations it is generally a good idea to include a count `n()`. For example, let’s look at the (not cancelled) planes that have the highest average delays:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>% 
  arrange(delay)
```


## `summarize()` useful functions

There are a number of useful summary functions:

* Measures of location: `mean(x)`, `sum(x)`, `median(x)`.
* Measures of spread: `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)`.
* Measures of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`.
* Measures of position: `first(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`, `last(x)`.
* Counts: `n()`, `sum(!is.na(x))`, `n_distinct(x)`.
* Counts and proportions of logical values: `sum(x > 10)`, `mean(y == 0)`.

## `summarize()` exercises

5. Use `summarize()` to 

    a. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?
    b. Find the carrier with the worst delays.


## `summarize()` exercises solutions
Number of cancelled flights per day

```{r}
cancelled_delayed <- 
  flights %>%
  mutate(cancelled = (is.na(arr_delay) | 
                        is.na(dep_delay))) %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarise(prop_cancelled = mean(cancelled),
            avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `summarize()` exercises solutions
```{r, message = FALSE, echo =FALSE}
ggplot(cancelled_delayed, aes(x = avg_dep_delay, prop_cancelled)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


## `summarize()` exercises solutions
Frontier Airlines (FL) has the worst delays.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(arr_delay))
```

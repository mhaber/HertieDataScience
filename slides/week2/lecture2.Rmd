## Plan for Today

1. **Making sure everyone is set up**

2. **Data visualization in base R**

3. **Data visualization with ggplot2**

4. **Excercises**

# Making sure everyone is set up

## Packages

Load the tidyverse 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you get the error message "there is no package called ‘tidyverse’", you'll need to first install it, then run `library()` again.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data visualization in base R

## Why do we use graphs in data analysis?

- To understand data properties
- To find patterns in data
- To suggest modeling strategies
- To "debug" analyses
- To communicate results

## Plotting with R

R has a powerful graphics engine to produce high quality graphs e.g.:

- `plot`: Basic plotting function (e.g. for scatter plots)
- `hist()`: Histograms
- `dotchart()`: Dot plots
- `boxplot()`: Box-and-whisker plots

## Histograms
```{r, echo=T, fig.width= 4, fig.height = 2.5}
# Create a histogram
data(swiss)
hist(swiss$Fertility, freq=FALSE, main="Fertility Rates")
```

## Dotchart

```{r, echo=T, fig.width= 6, fig.height = 3.5}
# Create a dot plot
data(swiss)
dotchart(swiss[1:5,2], labels=rownames(swiss))
```

# Data visualization with ggplot2

## Why use ggplot2
Base R functions like `plot` and `hist` are great for quickly displaying data but are not very aesthetic, and are limited in the quantity and type of information conveyed.

R has several systems for making graphs, but `ggplot2` is one of the most elegant and most versatile. `ggplot2` implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs.

## ggplot2 examples

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/weather.png")
```

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vaccination.png")
```

## The grammar of graphics
- Each plot is made of layers. Layers include the coordinate system (x-y), points, labels, etc.
- Each layer has aesthetics (`aes`) including x & y, size, shape, and color.
- The main layer types are called geometrics(`geom`) and include
lines, points, etc.

## The grammar of graphics

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot.png")
```

## Components of a ggplot2 graph

- \alert{data:} Variables mapped to aesthetic attributes
- \alert{aesthetic}: Visual property of the plot objects
- \alert{geom:} Geometrical object used to represent data
- \alert{stats:} Statistical transformations of the data
- \alert{scales:} Values mapped to aesthetic attributes
- \alert{coord:} Coordinate system
- \alert{facets:} Subplots that each display one subset of the data

## ggplot2 basic

A `ggplot` is build piece by piece

1. We need some data to be plotted

# Exercises

## Aesthetic mappings

1. What's gone wrong with this code?

```{r, fig.width= 5, fig.height = 2.4}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
                           color = "blue"))
```

## Aesthetic mappings

2. Map a continuous variable from _mpg_ to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

# Group Exercises

## Group Exercises
In the rest of the class, I want you to work in teams of two and try to reproduce the following plots.

If you need help, this [Cheatsheet: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) may come in handy.


## Plot 1

Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graph.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width= 5, fig.height = 2.4,message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```


## Plot 2

Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graph.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width= 5, fig.height = 2.4,message = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

## Final thoughts

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/facebook.png")
```
